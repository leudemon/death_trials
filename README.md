a hustle with aim to greatness.

the project's specifications goes like this.
we are aiming to make an app that will  allow the easiest computation of mathematical calculations.
this will allow students and progfessors alike to be able to easily obtain answers to different Questions.

at the beginning the app should only provide the direct answers. however, as we grow and develop it...
there will be an option that allows the users to see different ways in which the Questions could be done.

1st step:
I.phase one
computation of basic calculations.(calculator)
>this will include addition, substraction, multiplication and division.
additionally,
different conditions that can render the calculations impossible or deep diving into complex mathematics will be made available as well. 
>>these include:
negative solutions and infinite solutions.
i.e: 0/0= infinity , 1 x (-1) = Negative one
II.phase two
equations.
